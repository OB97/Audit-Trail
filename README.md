# Audit-Trail
VBA script for tracking information on changes to excel files.

This was my first medium-sized VBA project created for my summer student position with BioVectra Inc.

My manager was looking for more detailed/user-accessible information than the default change tracker as I work with a lot of chemists who don't necessarily have the strongest computer skills and knowledge, or perhaps time to search through the application for the information, so it is a bit hard for them to access.

I didn't have a ton of experience in VBA but I found it pretty easy to catch on after doing some research and finding examples as I've worked extensively with higher-level languages like Java and Python.
